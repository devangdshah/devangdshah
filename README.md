- 👋 Hi, I’m @devangdshah , you can follow me on Twitter [@devang_shah](https://twitter.com/devang_shah) or on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devang-d-shah/)
- 👀 What is this page about ? This page provides info on what to expect if I am your leader. This is not an extensive list by any means but this provides enough information about my management style
- ### 🌱1:1s(One-on-Ones)
- Importance:  1:1 are super important to me as it dedicated time slot for us to talk on anything and everythign which YOU want to talk. Its about you and not about me ! 
- Flexible: We can change and shif the schedule as needed. If you prefere walk and talk 1:1 during sunny day or over coffee or in office conference room or prefer second half! I am cool with whatever option works best for you.  
- Its not: These meetngs are not a status report meetings unless you want to talk on this about it.
- For any pressing needs, do not wait for 1:1 
- Changes: Will update you on upcoming which can directly impact you. 

- ### 💯 Personal performance 
- You will never have surprise during performance review time. 
- I will provide eary and often feedback to course correct. 
- I will provide Red/Orange/Green indicator. While Green and Red are clear indicators. Oranage means one or mor behavious/improvements if left unchecked can cause serious poblems down the line.
- ### 📅 How to interpret my calendar ?
- Based on project, I may have meeting with the teams in other timezone and I prefer to have 2 hours of FOCUS time 2-3 times a week to focus on _Important but not urgent work_
- I am flexible in moving the meeting around to make time for urgent things
