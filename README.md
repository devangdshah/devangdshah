- Importance:  1:1 are super important to me as it dedicated time slot for us to talk on anything and everythign which YOU want to talk. Its about you and not about me ! 
- Flexible:** We can change and shif the schedule as needed. If you prefere walk and talk 1:1 during sunny day or over coffee or in office conference room or move to some other time! I am cool with whatever option works best for you.  
- Its not:** These meetngs are not a status report meetings unless you want to talk on this about some important project
- For any pressing needs, do not wait for 1:1
