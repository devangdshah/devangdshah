## üëÄ What is this page about ? 
- üëã Hi, There.I‚Äôm Devang Shah.This page provides info on what to expect if I am your leader. This is not an extensive list by any means but this provides enough information about my management style.

### üß± The team ! That's you !
If I describe my ideal for our team and each person on it, it is that we:
- Get the things done. Not just anything but the onces with customer impact
- Genuinely care for each other 
- Own the things
- Ask lots of what and why/Dive deep
- Keep learning
- Communicate clearly

### üéØ My Goals
- To empower you as a leader to figure out what you need to do , how to do it and get it done !   
- To have cler team and project tenets which can act as a guiding principals 
- To provide you enough context to understand your priority and focus over the next quarter
- To have clear roadmap with product/business partnership
- To earn team trust which will allow to to create a circle of safety for the team.
- To deeply understand your motivations and your frustrations
- To Stay connected and being accessible.
- To provide coaching ( not provide you direct solutions but help you figure out the solutions with GROW model)

### üå±**1:1s(One-on-Ones)**
- Importance:  1:1s are super important to me as it dedicated time slot for us to connect/talk on anything and everything which YOU want to talk. Its about YOU and not about me ! Its dedicated time for us to build relationship and earn each others trust.
- Agenda: You as an employee will set the agenda and will cover your items/topics first. My topics comes second.
- What it is not: These meetngs are not a status report meetings.
- What is  : to discuss a. your development  b. future expectations c. goal , progress & obstacles d. current/Previous 1:1 action items d. roadblocks/support needed/soft escalations e.lessons learned.
- Urgency: For any pressing needs, do not wait for 1:1 
- Flexible: We can adjust schedule & format as needed.Let me know so that I can reschedule accordingly. 
- 
### üíØ Personal performance 
- You will never have surprise during performance review time. 
- I will provide eary and often feedback to course correct. 
- I will provide Red/Orange/Green indicator. While Green and Red are clear indicators. Oranage means one or mor behavious/improvements if left unchecked can cause serious poblems down the line.

### üìù Hiring 
What I look for when hiring new engineers/leaders
- Ownership/Can do attitude  
- Required skills and ability to go over learning curve faster (its fast-moving world, learning new things is equally important than what you know currently) 
- Culture/Team fit. Would this person raises the existing bar ( better then ~50% of existing folks) 
- Communication/Flexibility 
- Leadership Principal mostly applicable for role (e.g ownership)

### üìÖ How to interpret my calendar‚Ää?
- Based on project, I may have meeting with the teams in other timezone and I prefer to have 2 hours of FOCUS time 2-3 times a week to focus on _Important but not urgent work_
- I am flexible in moving the meeting around to make time for urgent things.So just let me know.
